  role: PI (Donald Danforth Plant Science Center)
  summary: Dr. Shakoor is an expert in crop genetics and plant phenotyping and is engaged in several initiatives to develop cyber-physical platforms for remote sensing and the use of sensor networks and digital devices for in-field data capture. Sensor platforms and hardware from her previously-funded projects will be leveraged as testbeds for the current project’s software and infrastructure deliverables. She has an established and extensive network of collaborators in the farming community and will work closely with Drs. Esposito and Sagan in the community engagement and crop science validation activities of the proposed project. She will also co-advise one of the postdocs with co-PI Sagan on the crop science activities.
